## Remarks 

- The architecture uses UI and Data layers. Inspired by https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture
- Resolver is used for DI https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver
- There are a couple of unit tests
- You might need to update the third party pods (pod update) because the example in the repository was outdated and not compiling
- Tested on Xcode Version 13.3.1
